    <h1>Chocolate Cake Recipe</h1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (270g)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon table salt</li> 
        <li>3/4 cup (64g)</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups (354g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (64g) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>1 cup (227g) milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) brewed coffee or water</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Cook</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease and flour your choice of pans: one 9" x 13" pan, two 9" round pans, or three 8" round pans. (To make a four-layer cake, use two 9" round pans; the layers will each be split in half.) </li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cocoa, and sugar into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and mix at low speed for 1 minute. With the mixer running, add the oil and continue mixing until the mixture looks sandy, about 30 seconds more.</li>
        <li>In a large measuring cup, combine the vanilla with the milk and coffee (or water), and add all at once to the dry ingredients. Mix for 1 minute at low speed, stop and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then mix for 30 seconds more.</li>
    </ol>
